            <p>This is a game I created myself called 'The Hummingbird Flight'. Click on the blue bird to access the game. In this game, you have to dogde the clouds by jumping. You need to press the space button to jump. If you touch the clouds the game will stop and you need to start again by pressing the restart button. You also can not let the bird fall.</p>

            <p>This game is my recreation of the 'Angry Bird' game. You have to use your mouse to drag the Angry Bird while he is on the slingshot but when you release him, he will fly and you only have one shot. You have to press space to try again. You have to knock the pigs out and you will get points for that.</p>

            <p>This is the recreation of the 'Trex' game you will find on Google Chrome. You have to press the space bar to jump to avoid touching cactuses. You can press the restart button on the screen if you want to play again. The restart button only comes when you lose.</p>
